				<h3 class="center">Dancing</h3>
				<p>
					I love to dance. I used to dance when I was around 6 years old but then I stopped at around 9 years old.
					For many years, I didn't like dance at all. However, when I found out about Kpop and tried out a BTS dance
					choreography, I knew I wanted to do that everyday. Now, I have been dancing to different Kpop dance for just
					7 months and I never really want to stop. I dance for 1-2 hours everyday and sometimes 2-3 hours when I'm 
					very bored or free. It helps me. Dancing relives my stress and with all the beautiful Kpop songs, it becomes
					soothing. So far, I have memorized around 15 dance choreographies, 2-3 each month. This hobby is very active
					so, it helps me stay fit and healthy. Overall, dancing is something I plan to continue for a long time. 
					Here is a (<a href="https://youtu.be/bhWXw56puNY">link</a>) to one of my favourite dance choreographies.

				<h3 class="center">Reading</h3>
				<p>
					Reading was always one of my hobbies from when I was very small, around 4 years. Reading thriller books at night,
					mystery books at a trip or comedy books during breaks helps me cheer up everyday when I'm stressed. Reading  is
					like wandering with my thoughts. When I start reading a book, I don't easily let it go, it is going to be there
					with me all the time. Having reading as a hobby is also beneficial as it enhances your learning and observing
					skills. When you read, you stay calm, and when you are calm, you forget all your worries. To conclude, this is
					one of the most relaxing hobbies I have.

				<h3 class="center">Painting</h3>
				<p>
					Painting was always EPIC! Incorporating all the colors on the canvas is a whole new experience. I don't paint
					very well, however, I love it. You don't always have to be good at something you love, you just have to enjoy it.
					Painting is very interesting as most of the time, it helps me potray my feeling on the canvas. I don't get much
					time to paint since I'm very busy with many other things, however, when I paint I take about 2-3 hours and just
					have fun. I love painting sceneries because the world is so beautiful and I want to see that in my room.
					Painting is like drawing out your thoughts on a piece of paper. It can get complicated yet it seems amuzing. 
					I recommend everyone to try some sort of art. You don't have to be good, but it will eventually be very calming.
					One of my favourite youtube channels for painting is (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCcYz479zVIZ2JPSPaXHPKGA">this</a>).
