				<h2>History:</h2>
				
				<p>
					I have spent most of my childhood in Bangladesh (12 years). Bangladesh is a very festive country. Though there
					is a lot of people, traffic, crowd and chaos, it is a very lovely place. My family, friends and relatives have
					made my childhood very memorable.

					I have done many activities in the past. Participated in many programs and found new hobbies. As time went by,
					I stopped doing the things I did. People change, I changed so my hobbies changed as well. I don't regret or miss any
					moments since as time goes by I know change will occur.

				<h2>Past Stories:</h2>
				
				<p>
					The following are 2 of my childhood memories. They are very short but very memorable. You can take a look at them.
				</p>
					
				<h3 class="center">A Long Trip</h3>
				<p>
					My family, my dad's friend and his family, my cousin and her parents, my grandparents and I (basically a lot of people)
					went on a long trip to Sajek, Bangladesh (picture below). It was basically another city. It was very fun. I can't really tell the
					whole story since it's too long however, I'm going to share some parts. The day we were arriving at Sajek...
					It was very sunny like very very sunny and with Bangladesh's hot temperature, everyone was sweating (*already
					disgusted*). So, no one expected the cold and chilly weather of Sajek. We were like freezing when we had to go up the hill.
					Sajek is like a hill (kind of). It's like a city or village on top of the hill. The most surprising (best) part of
					Sajek was its cloud touching sky. Like no joke, I was surprised to know you could actually like "touch" the clouds.
					Anyways, we are going up the hill (freezing) and finally made it through. The village was... so beautiful.
					I was very shocked with the scenery. It was very bright with flower gardens like everywhere. Oh also, it was 
					in 2017. So, the place was very magnificant however, the cottage was... not very nice. Moving on, the next day
					we all went hiking or basically touring around the area, seeing many shops, small stores, monuments, etc. Suddenly,
					my cousin started having so breathing difficulties, that's the time when I learned, the higher you go, the harder
					it is to breathe. Poor her, the trip didn't really go very well for her. The next day, I remember, we woke up soo
					early just to try feeling the clouds. Everyone woke up (except me of course), I kept sleeping (very lazy).
					However, the pictures I saw were very very surprising, it was so beautiful (*wishing the pics were still there*)
					After 4 days of staying there, it was time to go back home. Ah, it was so sad. I didn't know I was going to enjoy so much.
					One day, I hope to visit Sajek again. It was just soo memorable. This was just a very short story of the trip.
				</p>

				<h3 class="center">Goodbyes</h3>
				<p>
					How does a goodbye feel? Mostly it feels sad, and it did. It was time for my family and me to come here to Canada.
					Leaving everyone back home was not very peaceful as everyday for a few weeks, I kept thinking about my friends
					and relatives in Bangladesh. This is a very short story of the last few moments in the airport before checking in 
					for the main departure. You (might not) believe me but there were more than 10 people just to see us off. 
					That's when the fact hit me that I was leaving so many people behind and going to another country where I know
					no one. Like normal people, everyone was just crying. I really didn't know what to say so I just stared (at everyone).
					Moments went by so fast. Last face-to-face conversations. Last pictures. Last hugs. Last real goodbyes. Ah, moments
					were slipping by so fast without giving me the chance to realize the situation. My family and I flew here. Canada...
					seemed VERY different at first (of cousre). I still couldn't process the fact that I left Bangladesh (my slow brain).
					When we reached home, I suddenly started crying (didn't know why). The tears just kept falling. Days went by, still
					those memories clearly float infront of my eyes. Sometimes wishing to rewind time. But, hm, in the end, Life Goes On!
					A very very very short situation but I'm glad I could at least share something about my past.
