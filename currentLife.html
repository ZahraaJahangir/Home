				These days, we are just living in the Corona Era. Nothing really interesting. Just normal days, ICS and the other 
				courses. Living amongst COVID is normal now. Wear a mask, wash your hands, social distancing, these have now
				been everyday routine. In these recent days, it's just ICS and other work, website design, study, eat and sleep.
				I hope things get better soon so, someday soon I can go to different places without having to wear a mask and 
				to think about COVID. The days are passing by, somedays are good while others are not that much.

			<h2>Family & Friends:</h2>
			
			<p>
				Family is something we all should value. Our family and friends are what makes us complete.
				My family consists of my dad, mom, younger sister and me. My relatives, friends and all my loved ones are
				also part of my family. 
			</p>
			<p>
				My dad is very interesting. He is extremely funny and silly yet very hard working and thoughful. My mom is
				extra-ordinary. She is so thoughful as in she is a very deep thinker that sometimes I'm lost in what she says.
				My sister, well, she is unique. To me, she is very different because, we always have so many fights and 
				disagreements however, she is always there for me. One thing I keep thinking about is how time goes by so fast.
				Seeing my sister change as she grew makes me look into how my life has changed as well.
			</p>
			<p>
				There has been so many friends in my life. There are people who will be friends then leave you and people who
				will be friends and stay beside you. Sounds very wise and common but it's true. I had so many friends when I 
				was younger, but not all stayed. When I came to Canada, I met 3 amazing friends, friends that I can never be more
				grateful for. They have helped me through so many ways that I will never forget. This year, in VP, I have made
				2 wonderful friends. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Through tough times, we find out who stays beside us and who leaves. I'm very grateful for everyone in my life.
				They help me make the constellation of my life.
			</p>
