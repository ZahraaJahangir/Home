				Hi! I'm Zahraa. I'm 14 years old and in this website you'll know more about me!
			</p>
			<p class="yellow-background">
				I'm from Bangladesh and I came to Canada 3 years ago on July 6, 2018.
				I'm very introverted however, once I know the person, I'll talk more than you can think.
				Studying takes up 70% of my life. I have to study at least 2 hours everyday.
				This year I have enrolled into the IB program and got to know many new teachers and classmates.
				I made friends and overall had a very interesting year with all the differences everywhere.
			</p>
			<p class="thick">
				This is some general information about me. You'll be able to find out more in the
				following pages linked.

			<!--My personality -->
			<h3 class = "center">How I'm Like</h3>
			
			<div class="right">
				<p class="thick">
					MBTI: ISFJ (Introverted, Sensing, Feeling and Judging). 
				</p>
				
				<p class="yellow-background">
					My personality is quite complicated. I am an introvert for sure however, I can't think of being alone.
					I really like talking to people and texting friends everyday however, I'm quite shy.
					Dedication and success matter a lot to me. I'm very QUITE. I exagerate a lot (when I'm with my close ones).
					I'm very funny. I panick a lot about my studies to be honest. Classy and simple are two huge words to describe me. 
					I push my self out of my comfort zone only when it's necessary. I like to force myself a lot. 
					I am VERY emotional yet, I can be very logical. 
				</p>
				
				<p class="thick">
					That was a short decription about my personality.
